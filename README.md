# TD-Design-Patterns
Examples from the book "Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software" built in Touchdesigner

As I'm studying Design Patterns I'll be putting together little examples so I can come back to it if I forget. This is mainly for writing actual code, but these examples are meant to show the concept.

For the most part I'm trying to port some of their example code into real world Touchdesigner concepts. I'm skipping some because they don't all really apply, like the Iterator pattern. We aren't really creating our own iterator here..

Feel free to add some and create a pull request.
